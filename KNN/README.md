# The Nearest Neighbour and K Nearest Neighbours algorithm

1) Load dataset using load_iris for iris and genfromtxt for ionosphere.
2) Split the dataset into the training and test sets using the function train_test_split in scikit-learn.
3) Implemented 1 Nearest Neighbours method. Run the model on both datasets: trained it on the training set and computed the number of errors it makes on the test set and the test error rate (the ratio of the number of errors to the size of the test set).
